13. What is Currying in Javascript? Explain with a real time example.
*/

/*
Currying is a technique that performs the transformation of a function with multiple arguments, into sequence of functions with single argument.

Example
function multiply(a){
    return function(b){
        return a * b;
    };
}
console.log(multiply(1)(2)); // 2
